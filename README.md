## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

Another quick project to practice on CSS. Nothing new that I learned however decreased the timing to do the projects in general. Used to take much longer
