## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.<br>
There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
